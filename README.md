# StifDev_TAP

stifDev_TAP is a simple text adventure game for Android, influenced by [dnimmo's](https://github.com/dnimmo) web project *[Project-Arklay](http://project-arklay.com).* 

Whilst the intention is to borrow the story (with permission), the design and development of this application has been done from scratch, with the aim of both learning Android development, and practicing good Object Oriented development techniques.
