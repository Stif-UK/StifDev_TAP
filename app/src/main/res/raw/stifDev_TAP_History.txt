A few years ago I undertook a degree in Software Engineering with the Open Univeristy as a way to expand my job prospects and fulfil a childhood dream of being able to code (#nerd). Since first studying Java back in 2012 I've been saying I'd like to build myself an Android application, but didn't really have a clue what to build.
	
In 2015 a good friend built project-arklay.com as a little side project and I really enjoyed helping him out with some testing. Then in June 2016 whilst on holiday with my family I spent a bit of time in the evenings working through an Android development course on Udemy and had the idea of trying to implement an Android version of Arklay as a little project - you hold the result of this little experiment in your hands!
	
stifDev_TAP was created for fun and practice - I've learnt so much building it, and whilst its a relatively simple app, I'm geniunely happy with how it's turned out. 
	
I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I've enjoyed making it - if you do like the app, please consider rating it on the Google Play store.
	
The project code is freely available on github (you can also file bug reports there if you like!):
